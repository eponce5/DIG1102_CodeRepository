<h3> I have been spending my time during this quarantine by going shopping a lot, even though this is a difficult time, 
    I still manage to satisfy my urge to spend money on things like clothes or additional groceries that I don't necessarily need.
     I also have been getting back into hobbies like writing for fun, painting, and reading. I try to cook new recipes a lot, like
    cuisines from different cultures. Through these past semesters at Valencia College during the pandemic, I have managed to get
     my homework done early almost all the time, so I can dedicate more time to slacking off and watching netflix or hulu with my 
     boyfriend. Now we both became very busy and with this new spring semester, I am getting back
     into managing my schedule around school, as well as my work and personal life. </h3>
     <h4>Three Things I like:</h4>
